graph based JSON-driven text reader


- parents go into a stack. Cross -1, cross -2, cross -n, incoming edge.

- a node is reverse-clickable only if its parent has no expanded children for which it is the only parent.
	- Test the last cross parent first.

- reverse-clicking a node removes the last edge in its parent stack from itself, and all of its siblings.



ben's phrasing
==============

note ben means that we reverse the node above the leaf in a tree

- a node is reversable if has no expanded children for which it is the only parent
- Reversing is the process of removing all outbound edges
- a node is visible if it has inbound edges and no outbound edges.
- backward-clicking on a node will try to reverse the parent node on top of its stack.
